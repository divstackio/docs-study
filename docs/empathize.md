## **Emphatize** ##

The first stages of the Design Thinking process involves developing a sense of empathy towards the people you are designing for, to gain insights into what they need, what they want, how they behave, feel, and think, and why they demonstrate such behaviors, feelings, and thoughts when interacting with products in a real-world setting.


### Personas ###

We started our project by empathizing with users and creating random personas that meets solutions for all users.

<details> 
  <summary>What are personas?</summary>
<br>
"Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. Creating personas helps the designer to **understand users’ needs, experiences, behaviors and goals"

### User stories ###

To better understand users we must create user stories based on the data of **personas.** This is so we can better recognize the user and their needs. 

<details> 
 <summary>What are User stories?</summary>
<br>
 A user story is a small, self-contained unit of development work designed to accomplish a specific goal within a product. A user story is usually written from the user's perspective and follows the format: “As [a user persona], I want [to perform this action] so that [I can accomplish this goal].”

### Journey Mapping ###



To get more information about the user we need to know their emotions and interactions between the product. We do this by creating a journey map. By capturing the user actions we can understand more clearly about their paint points.


<details> 
 <summary>Short summary of journey mapping</summary>
<br>
A journey map is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal.
In its most basic form, journey mapping starts by compiling a series of user actions into a timeline. Next, the timeline is fleshed out with user thoughts and emotions in order to create a narrative. This narrative is condensed and polished, ultimately leading to a visualization.

> **Note**
> We were unable to create a journey map for the persona "Leo" because he didn't have enough ability to execute a action. Since he was unable to communicate with locals and couldn't find any information related to registering his health insurance papers. We came up with the idea to create a **Knowledgebase** or **Informational blog** translated in 5 different languages so everyone could understand. Furthermore, in collaboration with government instances users could be forwarded to a appointment link. *More to follow in affinity diagrams.*
