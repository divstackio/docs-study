-   Research studies

<br>


## Emphatize

The first stages of the Design Thinking process involves developing a sense of empathy towards the people you are designing for, to gain insights into what they need, what they want, how they behave, feel, and think, and why they demonstrate such behaviors, feelings, and thoughts when interacting with products in a real-world setting.


### Personas ###

We started our project by empathizing with users and creating random personas that meets solutions for all users.

<details> 
  <summary>What are personas?</summary>
<br>
"Personas are fictional characters, which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. Creating personas helps the designer to **understand users’ needs, experiences, behaviors and goals"
<br>

!!! Summary

    Shima is a model that experienced a drastic trauma when she was younger. She has a quite busy lifestyle and is always on the move. Unfortunately she hasn't             recovered yet from her past and requires therapy twice a week. She doesn't have much time and wants to discover a better alternative to therapy sessions.

!!! Summary

    Leo recently moved from Italy to the Netherlands and doesn't speak the local language. He wants to work but hasn't any legal documents like health insurance.
    He needs more information and whereabouts to get start working.
 



<br><br>
### User stories ###

To better understand users we must create user stories based on the data of **personas.** This is so we can better recognize the user and their needs. 

<details> 
 <summary>What are User stories?</summary>
<br>
 A user story is a small, self-contained unit of development work designed to accomplish a specific goal within a product. A user story is usually written from the user's perspective and follows the format: “As [a user persona], I want [to perform this action] so that [I can accomplish this goal].”
<br>
</details>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divstackio/docs-study/main/docs/img/USERSTORYNEW01D.png#gh-dark-mode-only">



<br><br>
### Journey Mapping ###



To get more information about the user we need to know their emotions and interactions between the product. We do this by creating a journey map. By capturing the user actions we can understand more clearly about their paint points.


<details> 
 <summary>Short summary of journey mapping</summary>
<br>
A journey map is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal.
In its most basic form, journey mapping starts by compiling a series of user actions into a timeline. Next, the timeline is fleshed out with user thoughts and emotions in order to create a narrative. This narrative is condensed and polished, ultimately leading to a visualization.

> **Note**
> We were unable to create a journey map for the persona "Leo" because he didn't have enough ability to execute a action. Since he was unable to communicate with locals and couldn't find any information related to registering his health insurance papers. We came up with the idea to create a **Knowledgebase** or **Informational blog** translated in 5 different languages so everyone could understand. Furthermore, in collaboration with government instances users could be forwarded to a appointment link. *More to follow in affinity diagrams.*

## Define and Ideate


Advancing further in the design thinking process we come to define and ideate phases, Ideation is a creative process where designers generate ideas in sessions (e.g., brainstorming, worst possible idea). Participants gather with open minds to produce as many ideas as they can to address a problem statement in a facilitated, judgment-free environment.

<br>


### Competitive audits ###
**Competitive audits** are one of the many valuable steps you can take during the ideation process. A competitive audit is an overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. Analyzing the brands and products of competitors, or the companies who offer similar products as you do, can give you a well-rounded foundation of knowledge about the market your product will enter.

### Crazy 8's
Next up is pen to paper. Crazy 8’s is a core Design Sprint method. It is a fast sketching exercise that challenges people to sketch eight distinct ideas in eight minutes. The goal is to push beyond your first idea, frequently the least innovative, and to generate a wide variety of solutions to your challenge.

### Sketching paper wireframes ###
Wireframes help us establish the basic layout of a screen. A layout is the structure that supports how visual components on a page are arranged, like images, text, and icons. Because paper wireframes are inexpensive and easy to create, you can draw multiple wireframes for the same screen of an app or website to explore a bunch of design possibilities.

### Digital wireframes ###

We are contineuing our case study to screen time. We start by converting our ideas to digital wireframes through the **figma application**. 
If you do not know what figma is, learn more so here: <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/figma-crash-course/>

## Prototyping

After subsequently time emphatizing and ideating, it is time to start building. This is were the project comes to live with visual elements and prototypes that makes the app responsive. 

<br>

### Building a low fidelity prototype

After all our sketching and initial design work is done, we'll start by creating our first prototype to prospect the user flow and have a preview of how the product
feels like in a real-world scenario.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divstackio/docs-study/main/docs/img/LOWFI.png">

You can preview the low-fidelity prototype here: <https://www.figma.com/proto/ykun1JU0h20Hg1u51DDpIk/LOW-FIDELITY?node-id=2%3A17&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A17>

> **Note**
> The LOWFI prototype is outdated and hasn't been worked on since we push new features and updates to our high fidelity prototype by preference. 

<br>

### High fidelity prototype

Continueing our design phase, we move to a high-fi prototype. This is how a product should look or feel like for a user. 
First we make the mockups followed by a layout, then we create a user flow and afterwards we add transitions and animations.

<br>


## Testing Phase ##

The final step in the design thinking process is testing the application and conduct research to gain insights based on users feelings, opinions and biases. 
Following this section we can iterate back to the ideate phase and forward to comply with new ideas and features obtained by feedback. 

### Research study ###

Let's outline our project goals and define our principle questions.
You can view/download the research study plan here: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_eRbcqvp7kbn5VP1D-fnfE6kv8luGE9_3Hh3GNpvjXY/edit?usp=sharing>

### Affinity diagrams ###

An affinity diagram is a collection of large amounts of data that is organized into groups or themes based on their relationships. The affinity diagram process is great when you want to make sense of insights gathered during research, as well as when you want to organize ideas generated during ideation sessions.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divstackio/docs-study/main/docs/img/affinity02.jpg">

#### Gathering ####
In the first phase we come up with as many ideas, insights or concepts as possible. We gather all of these on sticky notes.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divstackio/docs-study/main/docs/img/affinity%231.png">
<br>

#### Creating themes ####
Secondly, we start organising our concepts in themes (groupings).
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divstackio/docs-study/main/docs/img/affinity%232.png">


<br>
#### Create insights ####
Once we've collected everything, it is time to create insights based on the data we gathered.

<br>

#### Prioritize data ####

The final stage is to prioritize the most important features.

## Progressive Enhancement ##

We are moving from our mobile app to desktop viewport, this is called progessive enhancement. To ensure responsiveness, every device must be able to view content according to their screen size. 

### Information architecture (IA) ###
