## Testing Phase ##

The final step in the design thinking process is testing the application and conduct research to gain insights based on users feelings, opinions and biases. 
Following this section we can iterate back to the ideate phase and forward to comply with new ideas and features obtained by feedback. 

### Research study ###

Let's outline our project goals and define our principle questions.

### Affinity diagrams ###

An affinity diagram is a collection of large amounts of data that is organized into groups or themes based on their relationships. The affinity diagram process is great when you want to make sense of insights gathered during research, as well as when you want to organize ideas generated during ideation sessions.

#### Gathering ####
In the first phase we come up with as many ideas, insights or concepts as possible. We gather all of these on sticky notes.

#### Creating themes ####
Secondly, we start organising our concepts in themes (groupings).

#### Create insights ####
Once we've collected everything, it is time to create insights based on the data we gathered.

## Progressive Enhancement ##

We are moving from our mobile app to desktop viewport, this is called progessive enhancement. To ensure responsiveness, every device must be able to view content according to their screen size.

### Information architecture (IA) ###

IA or also known as sitemaps

    * Sed sagittis eleifend rutrum
    * Donec vitae suscipit est
    * Nulla tempor lobortis orci

=== "Ordered list"

    1. Sed sagittis eleifend rutrum
    2. Donec vitae suscipit est
