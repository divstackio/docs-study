Advancing further in the design thinking process we come to define and ideate phases, Ideation is a creative process where designers generate ideas in sessions (e.g., brainstorming, worst possible idea). Participants gather with open minds to produce as many ideas as they can to address a problem statement in a facilitated, judgment-free environment.

### Competitive audits ###
**Competitive audits** are one of the many valuable steps you can take during the ideation process. A competitive audit is an overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. Analyzing the brands and products of competitors, or the companies who offer similar products as you do, can give you a well-rounded foundation of knowledge about the market your product will enter.

### Crazy 8's
Next up is pen to paper. Crazy 8’s is a core Design Sprint method. It is a fast sketching exercise that challenges people to sketch eight distinct ideas in eight minutes. The goal is to push beyond your first idea, frequently the least innovative, and to generate a wide variety of solutions to your challenge.

### Sketching paper wireframes ###
Wireframes help us establish the basic layout of a screen. A layout is the structure that supports how visual components on a page are arranged, like images, text, and icons. Because paper wireframes are inexpensive and easy to create, you can draw multiple wireframes for the same screen of an app or website to explore a bunch of design possibilities.

### Digital wireframes ###

We are contineuing our case study to screen time. We start by converting our ideas to digital wireframes through the **figma application**.
