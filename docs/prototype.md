## Prototyping

After subsequently time emphatizing and ideating, it is time to start building. This is were the project comes to live with visual elements and prototypes that makes the app responsive.

### Building a low fidelity prototype

After all our sketching and initial design work is done, we'll start by creating our first prototype to prospect the user flow and have a preview of how the product
feels like in a real-world scenario.

You can preview the low-fidelity prototype here: <https://www.figma.com/proto/ykun1JU0h20Hg1u51DDpIk/LOW-FIDELITY?node-id=2%3A17&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A17>

> **Note**
> The LOWFI prototype is outdated and hasn't been worked on since we push new features and updates to our high fidelity prototype by preference.

### High fidelity prototype

Continueing our design phase, we move to a high-fi prototype. This is how a product should look or feel like for a user. 
First we make the mockups followed by a layout, then we create a user flow and afterwards we add transitions and animations.
